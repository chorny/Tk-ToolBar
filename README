NAME
    Tk::ToolBar - A toolbar widget for Perl/Tk

SYNOPSIS
            use Tk;
            use Tk::ToolBar;

            my $mw = new MainWindow;
            my $tb = $mw->ToolBar(qw/-movable 1 -side top/);

            $tb->ToolButton(-text => 'test');
            $tb->ToolButton(-text => 'Me');

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a dockable toolbar. It is in the same spirit as
    the "short-cut" toolbars found in most major applications, such as most
    web browsers and text editors (where you find the "back" or "save"
    buttons).

    Buuttons of any type (regular, check, radio) can be packed inside this
    widget. Moreover, the ToolBar itself can be made dockable, such that it
    can be dragged to any edge of your window.

    The ToolBar is supposed to be created as a child of a Toplevel
    (MainWindow is a Toplevel widget). You are free to experiment otherwise,
    but expect the unexpected :-)

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
    The ToolBar widget takes the following arguments:

    -side
        This option tells the ToolBar what edge to stick to. Can be one of
        'top', 'bottom', 'left' or 'right'. Defaults to 'top'. This option
        can be set only during object creation.

    -movable
        This option specifies whether the ToolBar is dockable or not. A
        dockable ToolBar can be dragged around with the mouse to any edge of
        the window. Default is 1.

    -close
        This options specifies, in pixels, how close we have to drag the
        ToolBar an edge for the ToolBar to stick to it.

WIDGET METHODS
    *$ToolBar*->ToolButton(?-type => *buttonType*,? *options*)
        This method creates a new button inside the ToolBar. The buttons are
        ordered in the same order they're created. The *-type* option can be
        used to specify what kind of button to create. Can be on of
        'Button', 'Checkbutton', or 'Radiobutton'. Any other options will be
        passed directly to the constructor of the button. The button object
        is returned.

BUGS
    Not really a bug, but a feature ;-) The ToolBar widget assumes that you
    use *pack* in your main window. Actually, it will *pack* itself in your
    window. If you are using another geometry manager, then you *MIGHT* get
    some weird behaviour. I have tested it very quickly, and found no
    surprises, but let me know if you do.

INSTALLATION
    Either the usual:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make install

    or just stick it somewhere in @INC where perl can find it. It's in pure
    Perl.
